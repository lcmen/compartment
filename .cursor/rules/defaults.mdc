- Prefer built-in packages in stdlib over 3rd party libraries unless there is a good reason to do so
- After adding or removing a dependency, always run `go mod tidy` to keep dependencies clean
- Follow TDD - try to implement test before writing implementation
- Use Go's built-in `testing` package for all tests
- Run formatter after updating the code to make sure it can compile
- Run tests after updating the code to make sure they still pass
- Don't import types from `docker/docker/api/types` but from `docker/docker/api/types/image` or `docker/docker/api/types/container`, etc.
