LaunchKit is a free HTML landing page template specifically designed for developer tools and open source products.

Read more about its features: https://launchkit.evilmartians.io

## Why use LaunchKit instead of crafting a landing page from scratch?

1. It’s a ready-to-deploy solution that lets you adjust the content for your product and launch it within a couple of hours.
2. Customization is as easy as tweaking CSS variables.
3. It includes all the essential elements to showcase your product. If something’s missing, just create an issue.
4. The template is mobile-friendly and uses a market-standard layout to ensure great usability.

## How to use it?

Simply clone the repo to your account and edit it:
- Decide which blocks in the template make sense for your landing page and remove the rest.
- Replace all “Lorem ipsum” text with your own copy.
- Upload your images.
- Set up actions for the buttons and links.

## How do I adjust the color theme to match my brand identity?

You can update the color theme in two ways:

1. Switch between light and dark modes. Add the `theme-dark` class to the `html` element of any page to enable the dark theme. If no class is set, the light theme is used by default.
2. Customize the color palette. Use this [tool](https://codepen.io/romanshamin/full/QwWgNLN) to tweak the overall color theme. Adjust the two sliders until both themes match your brand’s vibe. Then, copy the color codes from the tool and paste them into the corresponding `--colors` variables in `index.css`.

# How do I publish my website?

This template consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JS), so it’s ready to go. You can host it on any static hosting service — like Firebase, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or your own server. Just upload the files and you’re live.
